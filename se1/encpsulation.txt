What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP. It involves bundling the data (attributes) and 
the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. The key idea is 
to restrict direct access to some of the object's
components and to provide a controlled interface (through methods) to interact with those components.

In Java, we achieve encapsulation by:

Making the fields of a class private (restricting direct access).

Providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify the values of private fields.

Example Code for Encapsulation:

public class BankAccount {

  
    private String accountHolderName;
    private double balance;

    
    public BankAccount(String accountHolderName, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountHolderName = accountHolderName;
        if (initialBalance > 0) {
            this.balance = initialBalance;
        } else {
            this.balance = 0;  
        }
    }

   
    public String getAccountHolderName() {
        return accountHolderName;
    }

  
    public void setAccountHolderName(String accountHolderName) {
        this.accountHolderName = accountHolderName;
    }

   
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited: $" + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
    }

   
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrew: $" + amount);
        } else if (amount <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Withdrawal amount must be positive.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance!");
        }
    }

 
    public void displayAccountInfo() {
        System.out.println("Account Holder: " + accountHolderName);
        System.out.println("Balance: $" + balance);
    }
}


public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("John Doe", 1000.00);

      
        account.displayAccountInfo();

       
        account.deposit(500.00);

       
        account.withdraw(300.00);

      
        account.withdraw(2000.00);

        
        account.deposit(-100.00);

      
        account.displayAccountInfo();
    }
}

Explanation of the Code
BankAccount Class:

Private Fields:

accountHolderName and balance are private. This means that these fields cannot be accessed
directly from outside the class, thus ensuring data hiding.

Constructor:

The constructor initializes the object with the accountHolderName and an initial balance.

If a non-positive value is passed for the balance, it defaults to 0 (we ensure the balance cannot be negative).

Getter and Setter Methods:

getAccountHolderName() and getBalance() are getter methods to access the private fields.

setAccountHolderName() is a setter method that allows modification of the account holder’s name. 
This showcases how encapsulation allows controlled access to the data.

Methods:

deposit(double amount) adds money to the account balance, provided the amount is positive.

withdraw(double amount) deducts money from the account balance, but only if the 
amount is positive and less than or equal to the current balance. It also ensures that a withdrawal cannot exceed the available balance.

Display Method:

displayAccountInfo() prints the account holder’s name and the current balance, 
showing how to retrieve and display encapsulated data.

Main Class:

Creating a BankAccount Object:

A BankAccount object is created with an initial balance of $1000 for "John Doe".

Interacting with the Object:

Methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and displayAccountInfo() are used to interact with the BankAccount object.

Encapsulation:

The main point of encapsulation here is that you cannot directly modify the balance or 
accountHolderName fields. You interact with the object through methods, ensuring that changes 
are controlled and validated (e.g., no negative balance).

Output:
Account Holder: John Doe
Balance: $1000.0
Deposited: $500.0
Withdrew: $300.0
Insufficient balance!
Deposit amount must be positive.
Account Holder: John Doe
Balance: $1200.0

How Encapsulation is Achieved:

Private Fields: The accountHolderName and balance fields are private, meaning they cannot 
be accessed directly from outside the BankAccount class.

Getter and Setter Methods: Public methods like getBalance() and setAccountHolderName() 
are provided to access and modify the private fields. This allows us to control the logic 
when interacting with these fields (e.g., validating input, calculating new values).

Data Protection: The class ensures that data is protected from invalid changes, such as 
depositing negative amounts or withdrawing more than the available balance.
